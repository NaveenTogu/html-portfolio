    <hr />
    <h3>The Lord of The Rings</h3>
    <p>There are three parts in this film series. Every movie in this trilogy is a masterpiece.</p>
    <h3>Interstellar</h3>
    <p>This is my favorite Science fiction movie. This is the movie that made me interested in space exploration</p>
    <h3>Klaus</h3>
    <p>Klaus is one of those cartoon movies, no matter how many times, I watch it feels good and heart warming.</p>
